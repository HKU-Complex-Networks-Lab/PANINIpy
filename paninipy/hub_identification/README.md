# Network-hubs
MDL algorithm for classifying hub nodes in networks. 

The "hubs" function in functions.py inputs either an edgelist or a degree list for a network and returns the hub nodes, their degrees, and the corresponding description length/compression ratio for the methods described in the paper below.
