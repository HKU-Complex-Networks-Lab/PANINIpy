<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Complex networks provide a highly flexible representation of the
relational structure within a variety of real-world systems, from city
streets to the Internet <span class="citation"
data-cites="barabasi2013network">(Barabási 2013)</span>. The topology
and dynamics of real network data are often too complex to summarize or
visualize using traditional data analysis methods, which has triggered a
substantial research movement within multiple fields—including physics,
computer science, sociology, mathematics, and economics among others—to
develop new tools for statistical inference and machine learning
specifically suited for networks.</p>
<p>Research on complex network inference has the goal of learning
meaningful structural and dynamical regularities in network data in a
manner that is often independent of the particular application of
interest but relies on fundamental principles that govern a wide range
of networks such as transitivity, degree heterogeneity, and
assortativity <span class="citation"
data-cites="newman2018networks">(Newman 2018)</span>. For example, a
major research interest in this area over the last two decades has been
the construction and evaluation of a vast array of algorithms for
<em>community detection</em>, which aim to infer highly connected
subsets of nodes to summarize the mesoscale structure of a network <span
class="citation" data-cites="fortunato2010community">(Fortunato
2010)</span>. Another major area of interest is <em>network
reconstruction</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="peel2022statistical">(Peel, Peixoto, and De Domenico
2022)</span>, which aims to infer statistically significant functional
connections from time series or other activity patterns as well as
identify spurious correlations and missing edges in partially observed
noisy network data. A third focus area within complex network inference
is the clustering of network populations or multilayer networks arising
in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies <span class="citation"
data-cites="young2022clustering">(Young, Kirkley, and Newman
2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Although community detection, network reconstruction, and clustering
network populations are some of the most widely researched areas in
complex network inference, there are a broad range of tasks for which
there is active development of new methods. For example, there is a
large new body of work aimed at inferring statistically significant
structure in higher order networks <span class="citation"
data-cites="battiston2021physics">(Battiston et al. 2021)</span> and
networks with different types of metadata on the nodes and/or edges
<span class="citation" data-cites="fajardo2022node">(Fajardo-Fontiveros,
Guimerà, and Sales-Pardo 2022)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="statement-of-need">Statement of Need</h2>
<p>Due to their discrete, relational, and heterogeneous nature, complex
networks present new obstacles for statistical inference. Many inference
objectives on networks are intrinsically combinatorial and produce
complex summaries in the form of sets or partitions. These factors make
scalability and interpretability of critical importance for practical
algorithms, which are not often easily accommodated within learning
frameworks that focus on continuous ordered data. There are also a
number of ways uncertainty can be introduced in the collection of a
network dataset, whether through measurement error, sampling bias, or
fluctuations across experimental settings in longitudinal or
cross-sectional studies. These factors emphasize the importance of
developing new principled and flexible methods for extracting structural
and dynamical regularities in networks that do not rely on ad hoc
parameter choices or heuristics, allowing them to be robust in the
presence of noise.</p>
<p><code>PANINIpy</code> is a flexible and easy-to-use collection of
nonparametric statistical inference methods for unsupervised learning
with network data. These methods are unified in their motivation from
fundamental principles—currently, the Minimum Description Length (MDL)
principle underlies all the methods—and their lack of dependence on
arbitrary parameter choices that can impose unwanted biases in inference
results. <code>PANINIpy</code> is highly accessible for practitioners as
its methods do not require the user to manually tune any input
parameters and everything is written from scratch in pure Python to be
optimized for each task of interest without reliance on existing
packages. <code>PANINIpy</code> therefore provides an important
complement to existing network analysis packages such as
<code>NetworkX</code> that focus primarily on network metrics, network
visualization, and community detection.</p>
<h2 id="related-software-packages">Related Software Packages</h2>
<p>There are number of existing Python packages containing individual
methods that perform nonparametric inference with networks, but none
that are unified under this scope with the ease-of-use of
<code>PANINIpy</code>. The <code>Graph-Tool</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="peixoto_graph-tool_2014">(Peixoto
2014)</span> package includes a number of principled Bayesian methods
for complex network inference, many of which are nonparametric. As its
core functionalities are implemented in C++, <code>Graph-tool</code> is
also quite efficient given the computational demand of the inference
problems it considers. However, the data structures in Graph-tool are
often challenging to navigate for new users and its optimization
routines are largely dependent on MCMC methods which are highly flexible
but tricky to tune. Other popular packages such as <code>NetworkX</code>
<span class="citation" data-cites="hagberg2008exploring">(Hagberg,
Swart, and Schult 2008)</span> and <code>iGraph</code> <span
class="citation" data-cites="csardi2006igraph">(Csardi and Nepusz
2006)</span> also have methods for complex network inference but are
much broader in scope, being used primarily for network summary
statistics and visualization. <code>PANINIpy</code> fills an important
gap in the software space for network inference methods with very simple
dependencies in pure Python.</p>
<h2 id="current-modules">Current Modules</h2>
<p>Modules can be flexibly added to the package as needed. All modules
take as input a standard representation of a network (either as an
edgelist or an adjacency list in Python).</p>
